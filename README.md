Welcome to the Reptile Development Database! 

The RepDevo database compiles primary research on experimental manipulations of early developmental environments in reptiles. Presently, our database is focused on early thermal environments (i.e., incubation environments) and contains approximately 300 research papers and is an extended version of a recent meta-analysis by Noble et al. 2018a. The future plans are to expand the data set to incorporate other environmental environments such as moisture, pH, oxygen concentrations etc. 

To find more about the RepDevo database visit us online: [www.repdevo.com](http://www.repdevo.com)

The database will be updated regularly as new data become available.
