trait_cat,Incubation,"Each trait was assigned to one of seven traits categories. Examples of traits included in each category include: Incubation – time to hatching in days; Behaviour – Activity, latency to a behaviour; Development – growth rates of various body regions (snout-vent length, mass, head width and length); Morphology – Mass, snout-vent-length, head width and length, carapace width and length, usually presented in mm and grams; Performance – Sprint speed, maximal run distance, time to run, swimming speed, bite force and pull force, usually in m/s, m, Newtons (N); Physiology – generally hormone concentrations (e.g. testosterone, estrogen), metabolic rate (e.g., VC02/ V02 per time), Carcass ash, dry mass, energy and water content; Survival – primarily contains hatching success, but also survival to a particular age."
