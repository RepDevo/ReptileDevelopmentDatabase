trait_cat,Incubation,"Each trait was assigned to one of seven traits categories. Examples of traits included in each category include: Incubation _ time to hatching in days; Behaviour _ÊActivity, latency to a behaviour; Growth _ growth rates of various body regions (snout-vent length, mass, head width and length); Morphology _ Mass, snout-vent-length, head width and length, carapace width and length, usually presented in mm and grams; Performance _ Sprint speed, maximal run distance, time to run, swimming speed, bite force and pull force, usually in m/s, m, Newtons (N); Physiology _ generally hormone concentrations (e.g. testosterone, estrogen), metabolic rate (e.g., VC02/ V02 per time), Carcass ash, dry mass, energy and water content; Survival _ primarily contains hatching success, but also survival to a particular age."
